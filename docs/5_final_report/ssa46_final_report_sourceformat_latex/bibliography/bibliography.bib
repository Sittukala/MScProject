abstract = {Personalization of websites has become an important issue in Web modeling methods due to their big and heterogeneous audience. However, due to the existence of too many notations to represent the same design concepts in different methodologies, personalization specifications cannot be used out of the scope of a single tool or method. Moreover, in some cases, personalization is not defined as a separate aspect, being difficult to maintain and update. This paper tackles the aforementioned problems presenting a generic modeling technique to facilitate the specification of the personalization. Personalization specifications can be reused across different websites and different development environments.}

abstract = {A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.}

abstract = {Summary Usability evaluation is an essential part of user-centered product development. Evaluations can be done without users with inspection methods, or with users by user testing methods, such as usability testing. Usability testing is an evaluation method in which one or more representative users at a time perform tasks or describe their intentions under observation. To get information about the users’ cognitive processes, the test participants are usually asked to think aloud while performing the test tasks. In addition to traditional usability testing with predefined test tasks in a controlled test environment, there are several modifications available. Paired-user testing, peer tutoring, pluralistic usability walkthrough, visual walkthrough, informal walkthrough, contextual walkthrough and other modifications of usability testing offer a variety of methods to suit different goals and contexts.}

abstract={BACKGROUND: Usability can influence patients' acceptance and adoption of a health information technology. However, little research has been conducted to study the usability of a self-management health care system, especially one geared toward elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: This usability study evaluated a new computer-based self-management system interface for older adults with chronic diseases, using a paper prototype approach. METHODS: Fifty older adults with different chronic diseases participated. Two usability evaluation methods were involved: (1) a heuristics evaluation and (2) end-user testing with a think-aloud testing method, audio recording, videotaping, and interviewing. A set of usability metrics was employed to determine the overall system usability, including task incompletion rate, task completion time, frequency of error, frequency of help, satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Interviews were used to elicit participants' comments on the system design. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the qualitative data were analyzed for content. RESULTS: The participants were able to perform the predesigned self-management tasks with the current system design and they expressed mostly positive responses about the perceived usability measures regarding the system interface. However, the heuristics evaluation, performance measures, and interviews revealed a number of usability problems related to system navigation, information search and interpretation, information presentation, and readability. Design recommendations for further system interface modifications were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This study verified the usability of the self-management system developed for older adults with chronic diseases. Also, we demonstrated that our usability evaluation approach could be used to quickly and effectively identify usability problems in a health care information system at an early stage of the system development process using a paper prototype. Conducting a usability evaluation is an essential step in system development to ensure that the system features match the users' true needs, expectations, and characteristics, and also to minimize the likelihood of the users committing user errors and having difficulties using the system.},

In both these case studies we measure the various context, product and outcome measures

quality of the code (greater than two times) for projects developed using TDD compared
to similar projects developed in the same organization in a non-TDD fashion. The projects
also took at least 15% extra upfront time for writing the tests. Additionally, the
unit tests have served as auto documentation for the code when libraries/APIs had
to be used as well as for code maintenance.},

abstract={Online news articles, as a new format of press releases, have sprung up on the Internet. With its convenience and recency, more and more people prefer to read news online instead of reading the paper-format press releases. However, a gigantic amount of news events might be released at a rate of hundreds, even thousands per hour. A challenging problem is how to effciently select specific news articles from a large corpus of newly-published press releases to recommend to individual readers, where the selected news items should match the reader's reading preference as much as possible. This issue refers to personalized news recommendation. Recently, personalized news recommendation has become a promising research direction as the Internet provides fast access to real-time information from multiple sources around the world. Existing personalized news recommendation systems strive to adapt their services to individual users by virtue of both user and news content information. A variety of techniques have been proposed to tackle personalized news recommendation, including content-based, collaborative filtering systems and hybrid versions of these two. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of existing personalized news recommenders. We discuss several essential issues underlying the problem of personalized news recommendation, and explore possible solutions for performance improvement. Further, we provide an empirical study on a collection of news articles obtained from various news websites, and evaluate the effect of different factors for personalized news recommendation. We hope our discussion and exploration would provide insights for researchers who are interested in personalized news recommendation.},
